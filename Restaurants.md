## Onikai (おにかい）
- **URL**: http://onikai.isozumi.jp/
- **Genre**: various Japanese cuisines 
- **3 highlights**: Greate taste fresh local vegetables, Cosy yet vibrant atmosphere, exterior and interior really have "Kyoto"-ness
- **Price range**: ¥¥ (25-35 USD pp incl. alcohol. There is a course of 10 dishes with ~25 USD)
- **Distance from ROSCon venue**: 30 mins by train
- **Book in advance?**: Yes, especially for a group of more than 2.
- **Non-Japanese-speaker friendliness**: Sorry I'm not sure but at least the staff should be friendly and try their best to accommodate your requests.
- **Address**: Japan, 〒604-8026 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Komeyacho, 388, 2nd floor
- **Comment**: I visited this on almost all occasions. It's maybe tricky to find this restaurant for visitors from outside of Kyoto (even for Japanese) but definitely worth a try. It's located on a dodgy narrow street but once you enter the restaurant, there are many vegetables, friendly and energetic staff.  They feature fresh local and seasonal vegetables. I'm not so interested in vegetables and one of the guys who always want to have meat for dinner but the vegetables here look quite mouth-watering. Actually also there are many menus with meat.
